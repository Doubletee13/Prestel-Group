          <div class="ceo-bio">
            <p>
              <strong>Anton Glenn Heinrich Jr.</strong> is an internationally
              respected telecommunications and renewable energy systems
              engineer, serial entrepreneur, and philanthropic leader who has
              redefined what infrastructure means in the 21st century. As the
              Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Prestel Group, Anton leads
              a top-tier engineering and telecom conglomerate with core
              operations across the United States, the United Kingdom, and
              Australia.
            </p>

            <p>
              His life's mission is clear: to build the physical and digital
              foundations that connect, empower, and sustain communities around
              the globe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Born in 1963 in the quiet forests of Östersund, Sweden, Anton was
              raised in a modest household that prized integrity, resilience,
              humility, and community service. He developed an early fascination
              with systems, spending his youth exploring the mechanics of barns,
              solar panels, electrical appliances, and radio machines—an early
              passion that evolved into a deep commitment to engineering
              excellence.
            </p>

            <p>
              At college age, Anton relocated to the United Kingdom to broaden
              his academic and cultural horizons. He earned his
              <strong
                >Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical & Renewable Energy
                Systems</strong
              >
              from the University of Bristol, where he distinguished himself
              both academically and through hands-on project involvement. During
              his time in England, he also met his late wife, with whom he
              shared a strong partnership rooted in mutual support and shared
              values.
            </p>

            <p>
              Keen to deepen his expertise, Anton moved to the United States,
              completing a
              <strong
                >Master's degree in Telecommunications and Energy Infrastructure
                Engineering</strong
              >
              at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. His graduate work
              focused on next-generation telecom and smart grid technologies,
              with a growing interest in designing scalable, safe, and
              environmentally conscious hybrid energy-telecom networks—a
              specialization that would become central to his career.
            </p>

            <p>
              This chapter of his life embedded in him the entrepreneurial
              resilience that would later guide Prestel Group's multinational
              expansion.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the years, Anton pursued further education to sharpen his
              craft and amplify his impact. This led him to obtain a
              <strong
                >Postgraduate Certification in Signal Processing &
                Telecommunications Systems</strong
              >
              from the University of New South Wales, Australia.
            </p>

            <p>
              These academic credentials empowered him to bridge the worlds of
              advanced telecom systems and renewable energy, forming the
              cornerstone of Prestel's hybrid expertise.
            </p>

            <h2>Recognized Member of Global Engineering Communities</h2>

            <p>
              Anton is an esteemed member of some of the world's most respected
              professional engineering institutions:
            </p>

              <li>
                Senior Member, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
                (IEEE), United States
              </li>
              <li>
                Fellow, Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), United
                Kingdom

                Chartered Member, Engineers Australia (CPEng -
                Telecommunications & Renewable Energy)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Through these affiliations, Anton contributes to global standards
              on telecom infrastructure, sustainable systems resilience, and
              engineering ethics, while mentoring the next generation of global
              engineers.
            </p>

            <p>
              With more than three decades of hands-on leadership, Anton has
              overseen major telecom and renewable energy projects in Europe,
              North America, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. His teams have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Delivered solar-powered telecom networks across the U.S. and GCC
                nations
              </li>
              <li>
                Deployed national fiber-optic and 5G backbone installations
              </li>

                regions
              </li>
              <li>
                Advised on disaster-resilient communications architecture in the
                Pacific
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Anton is widely regarded for his ability to harmonize technical
              excellence with environmental and social responsibility, always
              aiming to serve the needs of real people in real communities.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2012, Anton merged his two leading firms, PRE Electrical
              (telecommunications and energy systems) and Comet GridTech (solar
              infrastructure engineering), into a single powerhouse:
              <strong>Prestel Group</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Headquartered in Kentucky, USA, with operational offices in
              Brisbane and Manchester, Prestel today delivers integrated
              engineering solutions across:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Telecommunications:</strong> fiber, satellite, 5G,
                microwave relay, and rural broadband
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Renewable Energy Systems:</strong> solar farms, hybrid
                grid design, smart metering networks
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Energy & Telecom Integration:</strong> sustainable grid
                tie-ins and resilient infrastructure
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Its presence in the U.S., Australia, and the U.K. marks it as one
              of the few mid-size engineering firms capable of delivering
              cross-continental, fully integrated solutions at both local and
              national scales.
            </p>

            <p>
              Anton's leadership reflects the same principles that guided his
              upbringing: clarity of purpose, discipline in execution, and an
              unrelenting focus on people. He is a mentor, keynote speaker, and
              industry advocate, often speaking on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Telecom's role in climate resilience and inclusion</li>
              <li>Ethical energy systems in underserved regions</li>
              <li>The intersection of AI, telecom, and sustainability</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              He actively promotes STEM education in disadvantaged communities
              and sponsors apprenticeships and internships to ensure the future
              of engineering is both diverse and human-centered.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2009, Anton began hosting charitable galas to fund autism
              awareness programs, inspired by a neighbor's child. His efforts
              have since expanded across causes related to education, mental
              health, and family services.
            </p>

            <p>
              For Anton, building infrastructure is only one part of the
              mission. The other is building lives, futures, and dignity.
            </p>

            <h2>Personal Life & Legacy</h2>

            <p>
              A family man at heart, Anton lives by the same values that
              launched his career: humility, wonder, and legacy. He often says
              that the best structures are not made of steel or concrete, but of
              love, memory, and shared purpose.
            </p>
