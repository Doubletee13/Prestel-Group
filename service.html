            <h3>Customer acquisition</h3>
            <p>
              Even with a detailed feasibility study, there's no replacement for real-world market testing. In areas that differ from those already served by our systems, we highly advise launching a pilot project to verify market suitability and resolve technical or logistical issues before scaling up. Based on our experience, pilot projects help avoid costly mistakes and delays in the long run. We offer the required mini-grid infrastructure and handle the entire pilot process from setup to execution. During the pilot phase, we deliver thorough performance reports and strategic recommendations to refine deployment and maximize revenue.
